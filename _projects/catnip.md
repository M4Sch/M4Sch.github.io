## About the Project
Catnip is a 2D platformer where the player is a cat that has to push as many items as possible off of furniture. 
There is a timer running out, until which the player should collect as many points as possible from the destruction. 
Pushing off a certain item - a fishtank - brings the most points, but also reduces the time the player has left by a certain amount.

## Key Features
<ul>
    <li>items can be pushed off of furniture</li>
    <li>destroying a fishtank brings the most points, but also costs time</li>
</ul>

## Development Process
This game was the first game I ever made. It was developed in 1-2 weeks during my second semester at FH Salzburg. 
The game is written in C#, using the library SFML.
<br>
The assets, except for the font, were created by me.
