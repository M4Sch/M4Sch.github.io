## About the Project
In this 2D platformer, the player is a small wizard who casts spells by combining collected ingredients in a pan. 
Different ingredients have different effects. Spell effects are determined by the order ingredients are added. 
The effects are damage type, flight trajectory and number of projectiles that can be shot when cast one time. 
The player is also able to parry enemy spells, sending them back to the attacker.
