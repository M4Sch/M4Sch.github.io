## About the Project
Abyss Hunter is a project made in a 48h gamejam with the topic "no strings attached".
The game is a small endless shooter, where players need to shoot strings off of the enemies, which are cardboard cutouts hanging from the abyss above from strings.
There are two enemy types: one ranged and one melee. Enemies are spawned at spawnpoints across the map, if the spawnpoint is within a certain range of distance from the player.

## Key Features
<ul>
    <li>ranged and melee enemies</li>
    <li>defeat enemies by cutting their strings</li>
</ul>

## Development Process
The game was developed in a 48h gamejam.
<br>
Enemy models, environment composition, and VFX were made by Alija Suljic.

### Personal Contribution
