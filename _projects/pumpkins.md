## About the Project
PumpKins is a whack-a-mole like rythm game, where players have to protect their halloween pumpkins from ghost rats. 
For this task, they have the duration of a song, the rythm of which also determines when a pumpkin opens. 
Pumpkins can either contain a ghost rat or sweets, the player should only hit rats, if they hit a closed pumpkin, 
or one containing sweets, the pumpkin takes damage. Pumpkins are destroyed if they get hit 2 times.

<ul>
    <li>pumpkins opening and closing with the rythm</li>
