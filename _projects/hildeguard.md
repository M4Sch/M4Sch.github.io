## About the Project
Hildeguard is a tower defence game with RTS elements. Players need to protect a relic in their monastery from 
enemies that spawn during the night. To do this, they can assign units to rooms and upgrade them during the preparation phase, 
amd control them during the attack phase in the night. If the player manages to kill all enemy units, a new day starts, 
and they invest their reward in more units and upgrades.
<br>
There are two kinds of units for the player and the enemies. The player has a ranged nun with a crossbow, and a tanky monk, 
who attacks with his keg of ale. The enemy units are a floating head spitting fireballs at range, and a cardinal slapping his way 
to the relic.
<br>
The player also has a hero: Hildeguard herself. This hero has the ability of healing her allies and herself. She can be controlled 
just like the other player units.

## Key Features

    <li>two different phases for preparation and defending</li>

</ul>

## Development Process
Hildeguard was created in a span of one year, in collaboration with artists. 
The game was initially developed in Godot Engine, using C#, but after problems with the engine arose, we switched back to Unity Engine. 
In the team of five artists and two programmers, I was in charge of character AI.
