## About the Project
This game is a local multiplayer 2D game where two players compete against eachother by stacking chairs. 
Players take turns throwing chairs by swinging them on a rope and letting them go at the right moment, 
trying to increase the tower's height.
It is my second game, written in C++, also using SFML.

## Key Features
<ul>
    <li>chairs are swung on ropes and must be released at the right moment</li>
    <li>chairs that hit the tower stick to it</li>
    <li>the highest point of the tower needs to be topped in order to earn points</li>
</ul>

## Development Process
This game was made in a bit over 2 weeks in a team effort, using C++ and SFML. The assets, except for the font, were created by me.

## Technologies Used
<ul>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>SFML</li>
</ul>
