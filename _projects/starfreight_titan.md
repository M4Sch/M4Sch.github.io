## About the Project
Starfreight Titan is a 2-player local network coop space shooter game, where players work together to protect the Starfreight Company's mining ship "Titan" from enemies trying to sabotage their mining activities. <br>
The mining ship flies from asteroid to asteroid, mining each one, while players have to protect it from the waves of enemies trying to stop the Starfreight Corporation's endeavours.

### Ships
There are five different ships in this game: <br>
Players can play as either the agile fighter, or the slightly slower ship fitted with a railgun. <br>
Enemies come in two variants: the four-pronged attackers shoot their target, while automated bombers approach their target heads-on, and explode if they're close enough, dealing large amounts of damage. <br>
And, of course, there is the mining ship Titan, which relies on the players to protect it while it flies from asteroid to asteroid, mining each one.

### Controls
W - thrust forward <br>
A - thrust left <br>
S - thrust backward <br>
D - thrust right <br>
LShift - thrust up <br>
LCtrl - thrust down <br>
LMB - shoot minigun  <br>
RMB - shoot railgun (Railgun Ship only) <br>
Enter - ready up for start of waves <br>
